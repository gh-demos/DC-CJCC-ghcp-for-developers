# GitHub Copilot Spaces Demo

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Spaces demo! In this exercise, you'll learn how to create and utilize GitHub Copilot Spaces to collaborate on development tasks within the Photo Gallery & Portfolio application.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this demo, you will:

- [ ] Understand what GitHub Copilot Spaces are and their benefits
- [ ] Know how to create a new Copilot Space
- [ ] Be able to set up a Space with specific goals and context
- [ ] Complete development tasks using collaborative AI assistance
- [ ] Share and manage Spaces with team members

**Estimated Time:** 20-25 minutes

## 🎯 Step 1: Create Your First Copilot Space

**Goal:** Set up a dedicated Copilot Space for working on gallery features.

This exercise uses the **Review upload security** and **Create API documentation plan** issues from the MCP exercise. If those issues were not created, open the **Issues** tab in your Enterprise repository, create them manually with those titles, and keep both issue URLs available before continuing. If GitHub.com cannot add an issue from `tdcj.ghe.com` as a source, add the issue title and body as text content instead.

GitHub-based sources stay synchronized as repository content changes. Individual files are included in full, while an attached repository lets Copilot search for content relevant to each question.

### Setup

1. Go to `https://github.com/copilot/spaces`
2. Select `Create space`

### Group A Option: Security Analysis & Hardening

1. Enter the name `Photo Gallery - Security Assessment`
2. Select the owner `Username` OR `OrgName`
3. Select `Create Space`
4. Under the Space name, use the edit icon to add the description `Implement security best practices for the photo gallery application`

> **Note:** The description helps people understand the purpose of the Space, but it does not affect Copilot's responses.

**Adding instructions**

5. Select `Instructions` and add the following prompt:

```markdown
You are a security expert helping to analyze and improve the security posture of a Next.js 16 photo gallery application. Focus on:

- File upload security vulnerabilities and mitigations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- XSS prevention in user-generated content
- Secure image processing and storage
- OWASP Top 10 web application security risks
- Next.js specific security best practices

Provide specific code examples and security recommendations that follow industry standards and OWASP guidelines. Consider both client-side and server-side security measures.
```

6. Select `Save`

**Adding sources**

7. Select `Add sources` and select `Add files and repositories`
8. Add the following files and select `Save`

```markdown
src/components/upload/UploadZone.tsx
src/lib/mock-photo-data.ts
src/app/layout.tsx
next.config.ts
```

9. Select `Add sources` and select `Link files, pull requests, and issues`
10. Add the **Review upload security** issue URL created in the MCP exercise and select `Save`. If the `tdcj.ghe.com` URL cannot be added, add the issue title and body with `Add text content` instead.
11. Select `Add sources` and select `Add text content`
12. Add the following content and select `Save`

```markdown
## OWASP Top 10 2021 - Key Security Risks for Web Applications

1. **A01 Broken Access Control** - Users can act outside of their intended permissions
2. **A02 Cryptographic Failures** - Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure
3. **A03 Injection** - User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application
4. **A04 Insecure Design** - Risks related to design and architectural flaws
5. **A05 Security Misconfiguration** - Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack
6. **A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Using components with known vulnerabilities
7. **A07 Identification and Authentication Failures** - Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management
8. **A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations
9. **A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Failures in logging and monitoring coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response
10. **A10 Server-Side Request Forgery** - SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL

## Next.js Security Headers

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

## File Upload Security Considerations

- File type validation
- File size limits
- Malware scanning
- Secure file storage
- Image processing vulnerabilities
```

### Group B Option: Documentation Generation & API Design

1. Enter the name `Photo Gallery - Documentation Hub`
2. Select the owner `Username` OR `OrgName`
3. Select `Create Space`
4. Under the Space name, use the edit icon to add the description `Create comprehensive documentation and API design documentation for the photo gallery application`

> **Note:** The description helps people understand the purpose of the Space, but it does not affect Copilot's responses.

**Adding instructions**

5. Select `Instructions` and add the following prompt:

```markdown
You are a technical documentation specialist helping to create comprehensive documentation for a Next.js 16 photo gallery application. Focus on:

- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Component documentation with usage examples
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- User guides and installation instructions
- Code documentation and inline comments
- README improvements and contribution guidelines
- Performance optimization documentation

Follow industry best practices for technical writing, API documentation standards (OpenAPI 3.0), and modern documentation tools. Create clear, actionable documentation that serves both developers and end users.
```

### Share your Space (Optional)

13. Select `Share` in the top-right corner.
14. Choose the sharing option for the Space owner:
    - For a personal Space, add specific GitHub users or set **General access** to `Anyone with link`.
    - For an organization Space, add users or teams and assign the `Viewer` role. You can also change the base role for organization members from `No access` to `Viewer`.
15. Copy the link and send it to the other group. Viewers can only access sources they already have permission to view.

**Expected Result:** A new Copilot Space will be created and opened, providing you with a dedicated environment for this development session.

## 🤝 Step 2: Collaborate and Share

**Goal:** Use an existing Copilot Space to complete the task listed below.

**Challenge:** If your group shared its Space, switch Copilot Spaces to try the other group's workflow. For example, if you chose **Option B** in the previous exercise, follow **Option A** this time, and vice versa.

### Group A Option

1. Go to the Copilot Space
2. Enter the following prompt to analyze security vulnerabilities:

```markdown
I need help identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in our photo gallery application. Please analyze our file upload component and suggest:

1. How to validate file types securely (not just by extension)
2. Protection against malicious file uploads and XSS attacks
3. Proper input sanitization for photo titles and tags
4. Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for Next.js
5. Rate limiting strategies for upload endpoints

Based on the OWASP Top 10 guidelines, what are the most critical security issues I should address first in this photo gallery application?
```

3. Ask another question! What else do you want to learn?

### Group B Option

1. Go to the Copilot Space
2. Enter the following prompt to create comprehensive documentation:

```markdown
I need to create professional documentation for our photo gallery application. Please help me:

1. Generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification for our photo management API endpoints
2. Create detailed component documentation with usage examples for our UI components
3. Write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for choosing Next.js 16 with TypeScript
4. Improve our README with installation, development, and deployment instructions
5. Create a contributing guide for other developers

Following industry best practices, what documentation structure would you recommend for this type of application?
```

3. Ask another question! What else do you want to learn?
